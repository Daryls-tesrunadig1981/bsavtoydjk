Whoa. So, just got out of Mountainhead and honestly, I’m still trying to wrap my head around whatever just happened. My back's killing me from those stiff theater seats but can’t even feel it right now because my brain's kinda mush... in a good way? It’s like they tossed Inception in a blender with a mountain climbing doc and added a dash of, I dunno, Twin Peaks? Yeah, that’s about right.

There was this one scene —this isn’t a spoiler, or maybe it is, who knows— where the main guy, Trevor or maybe Travis, stands on this peak and the clouds look like they’re swirling, like toilet water but majestic. I was actually there, feeling like my popcorn could just float right outta the tub.

> Oh man, these people behind us would not stop talking about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   afterwards, like seriously, shush! But also, how else are you gonna re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 scenes of him just staring into the abyss when your mind is the same kinda abyss? Like, blank but deep? Just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in a completely dark room or, I dunno, in the middle of a forest... might be too much like a Midwestern camping horror though.

Some characters felt a bit like undercooked pasta, you know they’re in the pot, doing something, but not really getting there unless you let them sit in the sauce for a while. I mean, Jenna or Gina or whoever she was, acted like she was just waiting for a bus the entire time... but in a good way cause every boring moment made the next twist slap you in the face with its unexpectedness.

My jacket’s all crumbly, found popcorn in places I didn't expect. Kinda reminds me of that scene when they’re scaling the side of the cliff... popcorn on my left, fear of heights on the right. Trevor/Travis has this weird fascination with rocks — like touching them, talking to them. Made me think, maybe I should talk to my drinks, might help me stop spilling them everywhere.

And the soundtrack was like gleaming synth-y echoes of whales singing in a submarine while someone’s washing dishes.

Look, my phone’s about to die so I gotta send this off. Anyway, Mountainhead is one of those 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 you walk out of and feel like you've been inverted, side-swiped, and molly-whopped by a mountain itself. You think you get it, but it’s more like the idea of breakfast at 3AM... feels profound until you try to articulate it.
